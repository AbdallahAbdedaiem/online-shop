# Online shop(ELZERO WEB SCHOOL)

I created this online shop following **elzero web school** ecommerce playlist on youtube. I worked with php PDO, jQuery and Bootstrap 4. Mr Osama really presents many ideas in this course more than just coding. There still a lot of work on the project so it's not a use-ready project. Feel Free to clone the project or share with me your thoughts on how can I enhance it or what are the important features I have to work on.
